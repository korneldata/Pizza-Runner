# Pizza-Runner-
SQL project

Stages of Pizza Runner SQL project:

1. Creating tables
2. Data cleaning 
3. Answering case study questions (including some database normalisation).

Throughout this project I used multiple sql commands and functions, including:
- aggregate (COUNT, SUM, AVG, MAX, MIN),
- JOIN,
- CASE,
- conditional aggregation,
- DATEPART, DATENAME, DATEDIFF,
- CONVERT, CAST,
- subqueries,
- CTE,
- User Defined Function,
- CONSTRAINTS,
- SELECT INTO.

This project was completed using SQL Server syntax.

Credits to Danny Ma for preparing this interesting case study questions (https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-2/).
